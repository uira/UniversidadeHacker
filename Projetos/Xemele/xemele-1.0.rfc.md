                    Create the XEMELE PROTOCOL - 
                    Xemelê is an Extensible Metadata EcoSystem with a Language Exchanging Protocol

This document introduce the Xemelê Protocol, proposed as a
Metadata Ecosystem, therefore exetensible, it introduces the Xemelê
Language Exchanging Protocol, as a really new IO concept, that
introduces a social, contextual and emergent engine of data
processing, whats enable the options the elegible our own set or
collection of algorithmns. 

If the Internet are Facebook, the XEMELÊ PROTOCOL will be the Graph API,
with their full metadata EcoSystem (the open and the closed side), and the
Deliverable Algorithm is now an IO concept, that use a
self-made-set-of-algorithms, to priorize the exchanging data priority betwen
the apps and systens you running, with all of your devices, ubiquily.
